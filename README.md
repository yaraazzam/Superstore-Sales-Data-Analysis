# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance using Tableau. The dataset includes sales, customer, and shipping information, which we visualize to derive meaningful insights. The main objectives are:
- To analyze total sales by region, product category, and customer.
- To identify top-performing customers and products.
- To examine shipping modes and their impact on sales.
- To track sales trends over time and seasonal patterns.

## Key Insights:
- **Sales Analysis by Region**: Identifies the top regions for sales performance.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Shipping Performance**: Analyzes shipping speed and delivery time and its effect on total sales.
- **Top Products**: Identifies the most profitable products and categories.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau**: For data visualization.
- **SQL**: for data Analysis
- **RFM Analysis**: Used for customer segmentation.
- **Data Sources**: Sales, shipping, and customer datasets.
